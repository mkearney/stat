   - [Tidy](../tidyverse/01-Visualize.Rmd)
   - [Data types](../tidyverse/01-Visualize.Rmd)
   - [Iterate](../tidyverse/01-Visualize.Rmd)
   - [Model](../tidyverse/01-Visualize.Rmd)
   - [Organize](../tidyverse/01-Visualize.Rmd)

## Computing basics

---

## File/directory awareness
- Every computer has a file/directory system
- There's a default or home folder
    - On PCs this might be the "C" folder. On Macs, this is your username.
- It's organized like a tree
    - You can move from one branch to another
    - Moving from one folder to another is a linear processâ€“meaning, you can go forward and backward

---

## Don't fall asleep yet!
Why do you need to know about your computer's file directory system?

- Because you need to know where things are to interact with them!
- Because you want to be able to replicate your work!

---

## tl;dr
Open your file browser. See how the files are organized? Yeah? Good!

---

## Don't let these terms confuse you
- `File` is the **name**/location of a file
- `Path` is the name/**location** of a file
- `Folder` is the **name**/location of a file folder
- `Directory` is the name/**location** of a file folder

<p class="note">file == path & folder == directory</p>

## FutuRe you

+ Using scripts and writing clear code will make your life easier
+ It's like writing down a routine of pointing and clicking that you don't have to memorize
+ The internet is full of routines/scripts that you can edit and customize to your liking
+ With some notes and some extra attention paid to make sure things are clear, future you will be very happy with current you!

## Data wrangling
+ Computing basics
+ Data frames
   - Wrangle: `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, `transmute()`
   - Bind: `bind_rows()`, `bind_cols()`
   - Join: `left_join()`, `full_join()`, `right_join()`
+ Text
   - Capitalize: `to_upper()`, `to_lower()`
   - RegEx: `str_replace()`, `str_remove()`, `str_extract()`, `str_detect()`
   - Split: `str_split()`
+ Numbers
   - Numbers (dollar sign, commas, etc.)
   - Dates/Times
