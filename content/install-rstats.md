title: Installing R/Rstudio
---

These are instructions for downloading and installing R and Rstudio.

## Download R

**R** is the language/environment (the engine).

1. Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/
1. Click on the appropriate operating system (Mac or Windows) to navigate to download page.

1. Download the most recent version of R. If Mac, select the first `.pkg` file listed in the "files" section (e.g., `R-3.4.3.pkg`). If Windows, select "base" (it's the same link as the bolded message about 'installing R for the first time').
1. Double (run) click downloaded file (check `Downloads` folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program. You *may* get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue---I promise the R pkg file is safe!

## Download Rstudio

Rstudio is the graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to use R. Once both R and Rstudio are installed, you can ignore R and only open/use Rstudio moving forward (Rstudio will use R, but you won't have to interact with it directly).

1. Go to the free download location on Rstudio's website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
1. Select one of the highlighted options that corresponds with your computer's operating system (Mac or PC)
