```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("broom", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("broom")
}
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
## load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

## read in exam 1 data
examdat <- readr::read_csv("https://github.com/mkearney/stat/raw/master/static/data/1-data.csv", skip = 1)

## create news_use, pie, and cat variables
examdat <- examdat %>%
  mutate(news_use = tv + news,
    pie = (pie1 + pie2 + pie3 + pie4) / 4,
    cat = sample(letters[1:4], nrow(examdat), replace = TRUE))
```


## 1. Simple (one variable) regression

Run a regression model for `news_use` predicted by `pie`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie
lm(news_use ~ pie, data = examdat)
```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m1`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie
m1 <- lm(news_use ~ pie, data = examdat)
```

Print the summary information for `m1`

```{r}
## summarize model results
summary(m1)
```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients
broom::tidy(m1)

## fit statistics
broom::glance(m1)
```



## 2. YOUR TURN - SIMPLE REGRESSION

Run a regression model for `fbtime` predicted by `age`

```{r}
## regression of fbtime predicted by age

```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m2`

```{r}
## regression of fbtime predicted by age

```

Print the summary information for `m2`

```{r}
## summarize model results

```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients

## fit statistics

```




## 3. YOUR TURN - MULTIPLE REGRESSION

Run a regression model for `news_use` predicted by `age`, `pie`, and `fbtime`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by age, pie, and fbtime

```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m3`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by age, pie, and fbtime

```

Print the summary information for `m3`

```{r}
## summarize model results

```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients

## fit statistics

```





## 4. With dummy variable

Run a regression model for `news_use` predicted by whether the respondent sex is male.

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by whether male
lm(news_use ~ sex=="Male", data = examdat)
```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m4`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by whether male
m4 <- lm(news_use ~ sex=="Male", data = examdat)
```

Print the summary information for `m4`

```{r}
## summarize model results
summary(m4)
```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients
broom::tidy(m4)

## fit statistics
broom::glance(m4)
```




## 5. YOUR TURN: DUMMY VARIABLES

Run a regression model for `news_use` predicted by pie and whether 
`fbfriends >= 1000`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie and whether fbfriends > 1000

```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m5`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie and whether fbfriends > 1000

```

Print the summary information for `m5`

```{r}
## summarize model results

```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients


## fit statistics

```




## 6. Smarter way to dummy variable

Run a regression model for `news_use` predicted by pie and the `cat` variable

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie and cat
lm(news_use ~ pie + cat, data = examdat)
```

Repeat the above code but this time store the output as an object named `m6`

```{r}
## regression of news use predicted by pie and cat
m6 <- lm(news_use ~ pie + cat, data = examdat)
```

Print the summary information for `m6`

```{r}
## summarize model results
summary(m6)
```

Use the **{broom}** package to get coefficients and fit statistics

```{r}
## coefficients
broom::tidy(m6)

## fit statistics
broom::glance(m6)
```
