## Linear model - ANOVA

---

## Overview
+ Hypothesis testing (review)
+ Covariance (review)


---
class: inverse, center, middle

## Hypothesis testing

---

## Alternative hypothesis
+ Also referred to as **research hypothesis**, this hypothesis formally states a **theorized relationship or difference**
   - Relationship between two or more **variables**
   - Difference between two or more **groups**
+ Research hypotheses describe **patterns**, not a lack of patterns
   - Every research hypothesis has a null hypothesis
+ Alternative/research hypotheses are typically represented as $H_{1}$:...


---

## Null hypothesis
+ The **null hypothesis** is the version of the research hypothesis that assumes **no relationship or difference**
   - **No relationship** between two or more variables
   - **No difference** between two or more groups
+ Null hypotheses are typically represented as $H_{0}$:...

> In other words, a null hypothesis restates the research hypothesis as though everything in the world **only varies at random**


---

## P-values
+ Calculate a statistic using sample data related to hypothesis
+ Convert test statistic to p-value
+ **p-value**: Likelihood of observing the data given a true null hypothesis
   - Absurdity of observing data if we assume null (no relationship)
+ **Significance**: p-value less than pre-set alpha level
   - Convention is .05

---

## Test decisions

+ There are two types of errors
+ Alpha = significant
+ Beta = power


|Decision       |$H_{0}$_true                 |H0_false              |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|
|Fail to reject |Correct (1 - alpha)     |Incorrect Type I beta |
|Reject Null    |Incorrect Type II alpha |Correct (1 - beta)    |


---

## Parametric vs non-parametric
**Parametric**

+ Assumes theoretical distribution

**Non-parametric**

+ Does not assume any particular distribution

---
class: inverse, center, middle

## Linear model - ANOVA

---

## Anova

+ Study effect of one or more categorical variables on a numeric outcome
+ Predictors are categorical (sometimes called factors)
   - Factors are comprised of two or more levels


---

## One-way ANOVA
+ A single factor/predictor (with mulitiple levels) 
+ Used because each value is classified in one way 
+ Null hypothesis is that mean at each level is equal


---

## Assumptions

+ Independence
+ Normality
+ Homogeneity of variance

---

## Anova
+ We can generalize one-way ANOVA to multiple factors/predictors
+ Just like regression, but we are modeling means
   - Intercept = **grand mean**
